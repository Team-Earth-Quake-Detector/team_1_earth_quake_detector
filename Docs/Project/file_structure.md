NOTE: In this directory structure, the Data folder does only contain the description of the data. Because we are using a realtime API there is no reason for our project to store the data itself in our repository.

The two documents under Docs/Project, namely the Charter and Exit Report are particularly important to consider. They help to define the project at the start of an engagement, and provide a final report to the customer or client.

NOTE: In some projects, e.g. short term proof of principle (PoC) or proof of value (PoV) engagements, it can be relatively time consuming to create and all the recommended documents and artifacts. In that case, at least the Charter and Exit Report should be created and delivered to the customer or client. As necessary, organizations may modify certain sections of the documents. But it is strongly recommended that the content of the documents be maintained, as they provide important information about the project and deliverables.
