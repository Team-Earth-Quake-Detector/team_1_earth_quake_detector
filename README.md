## 3. Methodological approach - Teams Data Science Process

The methodological approach chosen to process and implement the use case.
For analytical uses cases it is wise to follow a structured approach like Microsoft's Team Database Science Process (TDSP), which is the legitimate successor of the CrispDM methodology.
Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and tools for productive data science.

**Key Components of the TDSP:**
1. **Data Science lifecycle definition**
    - Business Understanding
    - Data Acquisition and Understanding (Data Source, Pipeline, Exploration and Cleaning)
    - Modeling (Feature Engineering: Feature selection, Transforming and Binding)
    - Deployment (Performance, Monitoring)
2. **Standardized project structure**
    - Template for folder structure 
   ![img.png](static/images/file_structure.png)
      - This is the general project directory structure for Team Data Science Process developed by Microsoft. 
      - It also contains templates for various documents that are recommended as part of executing a data science project when using TDSP.
3. **Infrastructure  and resources recommended for the project**
4. **Tools and utilities recommended for project execution**
___

## 4. Details of the approach

As we mentioned earlier, we followed the Team Database Science Process (TDSP). 
Therefore we created a project management board to ensure a structured approach 
to process and implement our Earthquake-Monitor project:

![static/images/Legend_ProjectBord.png](static/images/Legend_ProjectBord.png)

## 5. Details of the work
### 5.1 Processing of real-time data
- In order to develop a real-time updating map, we needed to included an API from the United States 
       Geological Surves (USGS) website.
- The API delivers our data, which contains all Earthquakes all over the world which took place in the last 24 hours.  
  
    > If you want to get further information about the USGS, click here:
        https://www.usgs.gov/
  > 
  > If you want to take a look at the data of the API, click here: 
        https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson
- Data Preparation:
  
    For Data Preparation, we extract relevant data from the USGS API & transform it into a usable structure.
    The relevant data contains different features,which are represented in the table below:
  
    | Earthquake ID |  Longitude  | Latitude | Time | Magnitude |   
    | ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---:
    | 00811746 | -119.4843 | 38.5368,1 | 1625824908214 | 2,0
    | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...


### 5.2 Geo data calculations
  
- With the help of the location (longitude & latitude) of each earthquake and the current or inserted location from the user,
    we were able to append some geo data calculations:
  > ***Filter radius:***
  > With this method, we can only show earthquaked wich are in the given/inserted radius of the user. 
  > If the user does not filter by the radius, we set a default value of ???
  > 
  > ***Distance:***
  > With this method, we can calculate the distance between the given location of the user and each earthquake in kilometer
  >
  > ***Number of earthquakes:***
  > With this method, we can count the number of earthquakes in the given radius and represent the amount of earthquakes on our website
  > 
  > ***Closest Earthquake***
  > Whit this method, we can represent the closed earthquake to the user on our website.


### 5.3 Geo data visualization with OpenStreetMaps
- We created a map with the folium package, to visualize the earthquakes and someother cool features and add-ons.
    > 
    > ***Earthquake Overlay:***
    > - This overlay adds the earthquakes from the API to the folium map and represents them though circles in different sizes and colours, depending on the magnitude of each earthquake.
    > - It sets a marker to the current location of the user as default or to the inserted location of the user.
    > - It also draws a line from the current location to the earthquakes in the radius, to make it  user friendlier to find the nearest earthquakes.
    > - If the user hovers over a earthquake, some detailled information about the earthquake, like timestamp, magnitude and distance pop up.


    > ***Tectonic Overlay:***
    > - This overlay adds the tectonic plates to the map. The user can enable or disable the tectonic plates by ticking or unticking the box in the layer control     > on the top right of the map.
  
### 5.4 Web frontend development & Web-service backend development
- To setup a interactive and intuitive website, we used the flask package. See 6.8 for details on how flask works.
- In total, our website consists of the following three html pages:
1. Home - index.html
2. About Us - about_us.html
3. Website Manual - manual.html

    > 
    > ***1. Index.html***
    > - The index.html file represents our home page and is the core part of our website.
    > - On this page, the earthquake detector is located with all its features.
    > - Also, the map showing the earthquakes within the specified radius of the chosen location is integrated on this page.
    >
    > **Challenge:**
    > - We had some issues to integrate the map into our website as a new map html file was generated every time the code run. We hence had to find a solution that allowed for the integrated file to be dynamic .
    > 
    > **Tips & Tricks:**
    > - We solved the above mentioned issue by using an iframe to integrate the map html file. In general, iframes are used to display content from another source, such as videos or advertisements via hyperlink or html reference in our case.
  
    >
    > ***2. about_us.html***
    > - The about_us.html file represents our about us page that can be reached via our navigation bar.
    > - On this page, the team is introduced as well as their responsibilities within the project.
    > - For each team member, the respective Github account is linked.
    > - By clicking on the button "Jump to Earthquake Detector" the user is redirected to the home page.   
    >
    > **Challenge:**
    > - We wanted a nice looking layout without spending too much time on it.
    > 
    > **Tips & Tricks:**
    > - The internet is full of great open source html templates for all kind of purposes. Especially for common sites such as about us pages there are numerous creative templates available. 
    > - We recommend to use bootstrap for building html website content. Bootstrap offers example code for all kinds of content elements and is relatively easy to implement and work with.
    > - Check out https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/ 

    >
    > ***3. manual.html***
    > - The manual.html file represents our website user manual that can be reached via our navigation bar.
    > - On this page, we explain the main features of the earthquake detector and how it is intended to be used.
    > - Screenshots are used for reference.
    >
    > **Challenge:**
    > - We wanted the boxes (in bootstrap called cards) to be of the same seize in terms of weight and height despite the different text lengths.
    > 
    > **Tips & Tricks:**
    > - Bootstrap makes layouting in html quite easy as it doesn't require you to create a separate css stylesheet. 
    > - Style attributes are added right into the class description.
    > - For the cards to have the same size, you have to add "d-flex" and "flex-column" to the class card-body -> class="card-body d-flex flex-column"

### 5.5 Searchbar for different user defined configurations
- In Order to make our website even more interactive and advanced, we included input fields that determine the search parameter.
    > **Location:**
    > - Default: Current location based on user's IP address
    > - Input: City name, coordinates, or specific address
    > - Output: Map zooms in to chosen location and shows earthquakes that occurred within in the last 24 hours within the specified radius. 
    
    > **Radius**
    > - Default: 250 km
    > - Input: Value from range (min: 100; max:1000; step:50)
    > - Output: Map shows earthquakes that occurred within in the last 24 hours within this radius of the chosen location.
    
    > **Radius**
    > - Default: 1000 seconds
    > - Input: Value from range (min: 10; max:1000; step:10)
    > - Output: Page reloads automatically after the defined time has passed.
